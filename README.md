This project uses two mode mean field model for soliton pairs to understand different atom transfer probabilities before and after fragmentation. 
The python code titled "PhaseSpacePlots_paper_v4.ipynb" reproduces the plot in our accepted manuscript-https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/ac9d60.
The notes present in the repository helps in understanding the analytics behind the two-mode mean field model.
